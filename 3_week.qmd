##### 1. Cross- Track Scanning System - Passive system

-   Widely used
-   faceted mirror- horizontal axis of rotation-aligned parallel with flight direction
-   sweeping= parallel scan lines oriented normal (perpendicular) to filght direction.
-   High Scanner speed is
:::

::: column-body
##### 2. Along- Track Scanning System - Passive system

-   Along track scanning/ push-broom scanners= movement of the ground resolution cells
-   has individual detector- insead of mirrior-
    -   to increase dwell time for each ground resolution
    -   hence elemination of scanning mirrior
    -   introduction of individual detector for each ground resolution cell (across the swath)
    -   placement of detectors- linear array (focal plane of the image)
-   orientation of long axis of linear array- Normal to light path
-   IFOV of detector- sweeps terrain prallel with the flight track
-   Increased dwell time
    -   ditectors: smaller IFOC (finer SPATIAL resolution) and narrow spectral bandwidth (higher SPECTRAL resolution)
:::

::: column-body
##### 3. Circular Scanning System - Passive system

-   mounting of scan monitor and mirror= vertical axis of rotation
-   path of sweeping- circular
-   only forward portion of sweep is recorded
-   processing and display systems designed for linear scan data
-   circular scan data
-   extensively reformatted (prior processing)
-   short dwell time (compared to cross- track scanners)
-   Application:
    -   reconnaissance purpose (heli and low flying aircraft)
:::

::: column-body
##### 4. Side Scanning System

-   Active system
-   Eg: sonar (SOund NAvigation and Ranging)
-   Application:
    -   Map seafloors
    -   Habitat of marine animals
    -   Detecting imaging objects in sea floors
    -   Transducer array sent and recieved
    -   Mounted on ship's hull
-   Benefits: less expensive
-   Issues: cannot measure: Bathymetry (depth)
-   solution: use it in tandem single-bean and multibean sonar

#### Factors affecting Signal Strength

### Scan Lines

"A remote-sensing tool with a line of many fixed sensors that record reflected radiation from the terrain along a satellite's direction of movement, creating scan-line strips that are contiguous or that overlap slightly, thereby producing an image" [esri](https://support.esri.com/en-us/gis-dictionary/along-track-scanner#:~:text=%5Bremote%20sensing%5D%20A%20remote%2D,slightly%2C%20thereby%20producing%20an%20image.)

Two corrections
:::

::: column-body
## Image correction

-   Raw remotely sensed data- ISSUES
    -   Geometric and radiometric flaws -- why?
    -   Curved shape of the Earth
    -   Imperfectly transparent atmosphere
    -   Daily and seasonal variations (receiving solar radiation)
    -   Imperfections in scanning instruments
-   why do we need image correction??
    -   to remove distortion= individual picture elements are in their proper plainmetric (x,y).
    -

### Radimetric Correction
:::

::: column-body
### Geometric Correction

-   PROCESS:
    -   correcting geometric distortion
    -   assigning properties of a map to an image

Source:

-   Relief displacement
    -   less factor: satellite remote sensing (due to altitude)
    -   high factor: aerial imagin
-   earth curvature
    -   curvature
    -   eastward spinning
-   ORBIT:
    -   ORBIT of earth:West to East
    -   ORBIT of satellite: pole to pole (IKONOS, Landsat, and the NOAA)
    -   Cylindrical projection: S shape waves
-   Each scan row begins at a position slightly west of the row that preceded it
-   first pixel in each row appears to be aligned with the other initial pixels
-   

Geometric correction solution modelling 2 solution: - Jensen page 244 describes - RMSE

### Atmospheric Correction

-   Need:
    -   To remove the scattering and absorption effects from the atmosphere
    -   why?- to obtain surface reflectance characterstics

1.  Atmospheric scattering (as we saw in week 1)
2.  Topographic attenuation (up next)
3.  Unnecessary
4.  Necessary
