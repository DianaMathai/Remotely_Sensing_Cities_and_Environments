::: column-body
We now understand the role of EMW its interaction, transmission, reflection, reception which that leads to data storage in bits (sensor (one or multiple) on a satellite\>sensor (active/passive)\>target area\> sensor\> recorded in pixel forming band\> multiple band with various information\> final digital image. (Refer Week 1)

We already know of types of sensors and what they do (Week 1), this week we learnt on how they do it and the challenges of producing the desired output.

The challenge here is the corrections that need to be done to the input received.

### Principle Imaging Sensor Systems

::: column-body
Indicated below is the two primary ways of image recording.

### Scanning modes

::: column-body
In this section we see how the Digital recording is carried out- by scanning!!, indicated below are the various scanning modes.

1.  Cross- Track Scanning System - Passive system
2.  Along- Track Scanning System - Passive system
3.  Circular Scanning System - Passive system
4.  Side Scanning System
:::

::: column-body
##### 1. Cross- Track Scanning System - Passive system

-   Widely used
-   faceted mirror- horizontal axis of rotation-aligned parallel with flight direction
-   sweeping= parallel scan lines oriented normal (perpendicular) to filght direction.
-   High Scanner speed is
:::

::: column-body
##### 2. Along- Track Scanning System - Passive system

-   Along track scanning/ push-broom scanners= movement of the ground resolution cells
-   has individual detector- insead of mirrior-
    -   to increase dwell time for each ground resolution
    -   hence elemination of scanning mirrior
    -   introduction of individual detector for each ground resolution cell (across the swath)
    -   placement of detectors- linear array (focal plane of the image)
-   orientation of long axis of linear array- Normal to light path
-   IFOV of detector- sweeps terrain prallel with the flight track
-   Increased dwell time
    -   ditectors: smaller IFOC (finer SPATIAL resolution) and narrow spectral bandwidth (higher SPECTRAL resolution)
:::

::: column-body
##### 3. Circular Scanning System - Passive system

-   mounting of scan monitor and mirror= vertical axis of rotation
-   path of sweeping- circular
-   only forward portion of sweep is recorded
-   processing and display systems designed for linear scan data
-   circular scan data
-   extensively reformatted (prior processing)
-   short dwell time (compared to cross- track scanners)
-   Application:
    -   reconnaissance purpose (heli and low flying aircraft)
:::

::: column-body
##### 4. Side Scanning System- Active System

-   Active system
-   Eg: sonar (SOund NAvigation and Ranging)
-   Application:
    -   Map seafloors
    -   Habitat of marine animals
    -   Detecting imaging objects in sea floors
    -   Transducer array sent and recieved
    -   Mounted on ship's hull
-   Benefits: less expensive
-   Issues: cannot measure: Bathymetry (depth)
-   solution: use it in tandem single-bean and multibean sonar

#### Factors affecting Signal Strength

::: column-body
The scanning is done to receive back a signal to create a pixel\>band with information. But! the signal we receive back can have varied strength due to various factors that affect it, indicated below are the same:

-   Energy Flux
-   altitude
-   Spectral Bandwidth of the detector
-   instantaneous field of view
-   Dwell time

### Scan Lines

"A remote-sensing tool with a line of many fixed sensors that record reflected radiation from the terrain along a satellite's direction of movement, creating scan-line strips that are contiguous or that overlap slightly, thereby producing an image" [esri](https://support.esri.com/en-us/gis-dictionary/along-track-scanner#:~:text=%5Bremote%20sensing%5D%20A%20remote%2D,slightly%2C%20thereby%20producing%20an%20image.)

## View: Perspective and Planimetry

::: column-body
Now we understand how the scanning is performed by a Sensor (above sections), we further need to understand about perspective. How the object can be viewed so as to better understand corrections.

## Image correction!

-   Raw remotely sensed data- ISSUES
    -   Geometric and radiometric flaws -- why?
    -   Curved shape of the Earth
    -   Imperfectly transparent atmosphere
    -   Daily and seasonal variations (receiving solar radiation)
    -   Imperfections in scanning instruments
-   why do we need image correction??
    -   to remove distortion= individual picture elements are in their proper plainmetric (x,y).
:::

![Distortion and Correction](images/distortion.png){fig-align="center"}

::: column-body
### Radiometric Correction

-   Precisely estimate the reflectively of an environment
-   Meaning: improve the brightness value/ reduce inconsistencies in image brightness (not spatial or locational aspects)
-   Errors= **Noise**
-   How?
    -   compensating for the distortions (antenna system , positioning errors etc.)
    -   eg: [ncl.ac.uk](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/tcmweb/bilko/module7/lesson3.pdf); [l3harrisgeospatial](https://www.l3harrisgeospatial.com/docs/radiometriccalibration.html)
-   Correction procedures [storymaps](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/9fe04283db7048adb93c642c3d07dfc4)
    -   Radiative Transfer Code Model: Clear atmospheric conditions, creating scattering models. requires data retrieved from ground. accuracy= High
    -   Image-based: Information source= image, accuracy= low
    -   Regression: analyses each band, estimation of brightness in each image
:::

::: column-body
### Geometric Correction

PROCESS:

-   Correcting geometric distortion
-   Assigning properties of a map to an image

Source:

-   Relief displacement
    -   less factor: satellite remote sensing (due to altitude)
    -   high factor: aerial imagin
-   Earth curvature
    -   curvature
    -   eastward spinning
-   ORBIT:
    -   ORBIT of earth:West to East
    -   ORBIT of satellite: pole to pole (IKONOS, Landsat, and the NOAA)
    -   Cylindrical projection: S shape waves
-   Each scan row begins at a position slightly west of the row that preceded it
-   First pixel in each row appears to be aligned with the other initial pixels

Geometric correction solution modelling 2 solution: - Jensen page 244 describes - RMSE

### Atmospheric Correction

-   Need:
    -   To remove the scattering and absorption effects from the atmosphere
    -   Why?- to obtain surface reflectance characteristics

1.  Atmospheric scattering (as we saw in week 1)
2.  Topographic attenuation (up next)
3.  Unnecessary
4.  Necessary
:::

::: column-body
#### 1. Atmospheric scattering

Types:

-   Dark object subtraction
-   Psuedo-invariant Features
-   Absolute(definitive)

:::

::: column-body
#### 2. Topographic Correction

-   Orthorectification Correction (6)
-   Radiometric Calibration
-   Landsat ARD- Surface reflectance
-   Joining data sets
-   Image Enhancement
