It comprises of summary, application and reflection on weekly learning of new concepts, processes, analysis and practice. I look forward to practice-oriented learning of the module, leading to building a robust technical proposal/implementation. I am curious to know which segment I would enjoy the most. I am a visual learner my Learning Diary shall reflect the same.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\--\n\n::: callout-note\nThe learning diary is part of an academic requirement for module [CASA0023](https://github.com/andrewmaclachlan/CASA0023-bookdown) designed by [Dr Andrew MacLachlan.](https://github.com/andrewmaclachlan) The content of this diary follows the outlined approach as designed in the provided [lecture material](https://andrewmaclachlan.github.io/CASA0023/00-course_info.html) and [workshop material](https://andrewmaclachlan.github.io/CASA0023/).\n:::\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nMe**?**\n\nDiana Mathai\n\nProfessional Education: Master of Planning in Urban Planning and Bachelor of Technology in Civil Engineering\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nand an enthusiastic novice to Remotely Sensing\n",
