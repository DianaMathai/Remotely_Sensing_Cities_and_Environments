In addition to this being an academic requirement entailing summarising, application and reflecting on weekly learning of new concepts, processes, analysis and practice. I look forward to practice-oriented learning of the module, leading to building a robust technical proposal/implementation. I am curious to know which segment I would enjoy the most."
