It comprises of summary, application and reflection on weekly learning of new concepts, processes, analysis and practice. I look forward to practice-oriented learning of the module, leading to building a robust technical proposal/implementation. I am curious to know which segment I would enjoy the most.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\--\n\n::: callout-note\nThe learning diary is part of an academic requirement for module [CASA0023](https://github.com/andrewmaclachlan/CASA0023-bookdown) designed by [Dr. Andrew MacLachlan.](https://github.com/andrewmaclachlan) The content of this diary follows the outlined approach as designed in the provided [lecture material](https://andrewmaclachlan.github.io/CASA0023/00-course_info.html) and [workshop material](https://andrewmaclachlan.github.io/CASA0023/).\n:::\n",
