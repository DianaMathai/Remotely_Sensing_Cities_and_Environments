This chapter is an attempt to comprehend Remote Sensing. To reach a basic understanding so that it becomes a bit easier to understand future lectures and reading supporting material. As a visual learner, I have opted for a visual representation of many concepts or processes, as it works for me (kindly feel welcome to search for the theory).

So lets understand few basic...

*How does this work?*

*What are these bands?*

*Is this word a satellite or a sensor?*

# Terms

Below indicated are the images that schematically depict few terms.

## Electromagnetic Waves (EMW)

-   Composition of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. (Maxwell's equation)
-   EM radiation transmission: can transmit in vacuum
    -   frequency, time period and wavelength= dependent on the producing source
    -   velocity= dependent on medium in which it is travelling
    -   high frequency of propagation= increase in accuracy
-   light🌞 = visible part = colors (corresponding to different wavelength of light) eg: rainbow🌈
-   Sound 🔊= invisible waves
    -   travels through molecules present in air (molecules bumping into each other)

### Spectral Reflectance Properties

So how do we see these characteristics of earth surface features or materials??

**Spectral Reflectance Properties!!** By analysing spectral reflectance patterns or spectral signatures.

-   Signatures can be visualised in spectral reflectance curves

-   Curves= function of wavelengths

    -   Eg: image below for water, soil and vegetation

### EMW Interaction

In above sections we have looked into what is EMW and few applications. This segment we shall look into how it interacts when it travels.

##### **Absorption** and **Transmission**

So let us look into the first two **absorption** and **transmission**
:::

![A schematic representation of the atmospheric transmission (0 to 22 µm wavelength range). *SOURCE: @tempfli2009a*](images/atmospherictrnasmissionpng.png)

::: column-body
-   Many wavelengths are not useful of RS of ES *(none of the corresponding energy can penetrate the atmosphere)*
-   Spectrum portion outside the main absorption range= useful range
-   Useful Range= **Atmospheric Transmission Windows**
    -   *ONE window* from 0.4 to 2 μm visible, NIR, SWIR remote sensors operating in this range are often referred to as optical ones
    -   *THREE windows* in the TIR range two narrow windows around 3 and 5 μm Third relatively broader approximately 8 to 14 μm
-   Longer wavelength= strong absorption
    -   Range 22 μm to 1 mm
    -   Very low energy transmission
-   Microwave range= transparent
    -   Range= beyond 1 mm
-   Measure: solar radiation outside the atmosphere= resembles [black-body](http://sar.kangwon.ac.kr/etc/rs_note/rsnote/cp1/cp1-7.htm) radiation at 6000K
-   Measure: Earth surface:
    -   Solar radiation at earth surface\> spectral distribution of energy= very ragged
-   Graph above:
    -   dip= atmospheric absorption by different gases
    -   energy\>\> earth surface= intensity reduction ? gas of increasing density.

##### Scattering

-   Occurrence: passing from one medium (air,water etc) to another
-   Light\>\>medium\>\>part light absorbed by medium\>\>
-   Intensity of scattered light= size of particles + wavelength
-   High scattering = short wavelength+high frequency (wavier= higher changes of collision with particles)
-   Low scattering = longer wavelength+ low frequency (less wavier/ straighter in comparision= lower changes of collision with particles)
:::

![](images/scattering.png)

::: column-body
*Factors:*

-   Wavelength of the radiation
-   Amount of particles and gases
-   Distance the radiant energy travels through the atmosphere

**BRDF The Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function:** It gives the reflectance of a target as a function of illumination geometry and viewing geometry. It **depends** on:

-   Wavelength
-   Determined by the structural and optical properties of the surface,
    -   shadow-casting, multiple scattering, mutual shadowing, transmission, reflection, absorption, and emission by surface elements, facet orientation distribution, and facet density.

### Active Sensors

![](images/radarflow.png)

::: column-body
Spatial resolution of radar data\~ ratio of the sensor wavelength to the length of the sensor's antenna

-   Meaning: for a given wavelength
-   Longer antenna = higher spatial resolution

::: column-body
### SAR

-   Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)
-   sensor produces its own energy
-   active data collection
-   can see through night, any weather condition
-   wavelength: micorwaves
-   A series of shorter antenna is combined to simulate a larger antenna
    -   Result: higher resolution

::: column-body
-   Radar sensors utilize longer wavelengths at the centimetre to meter scale
    -   Helps: ability to see through clouds
-   Produces: fine-resolution images from a resolution-limited radar system
    -   radar movement: straight line
    -   carrier: airplane or NISAR
    -   NISAR
        -   provide multiple polarization modes across its two radar bands
        -   24 cm wavelength L-SAR
        -   10 cm wavelength S-SAR.
-   How?
    -   transmits microwave signals\>earth surface\>receives back the signals (backscattered)\> sensor makes an image from returned echoes- bat flying in cave
-   Result imaginary built?
    -   Wavelength strength and time delay of the returned signal
    -   depends primarily on the
        -   roughness and electrical conducting properties of the observed surface
        -   its distance from the orbiting radar 
-   SAR has different wavelengths = bands
    -   **Bands:** X,C,L,P
    -   Important feature to consider
    -   Wavelength determines
        -   How far a signal can penetrate into the medium
        -   How the signal interacts with the surface
        -   To understand look at X an L bands below

#### PIXEL

::: column-body
-   The tiny Squares 🟥🟧- look at the image above (Just think of your phone's Camera image)
-   Unit of image = pixel (Picture Elements)
-   Represent the relative reflected light energy recorded for that part of the image
-   Each pixel= square area on an image
-   Square area of an image= measure of the sensor's ability
-   Ability of what??
    -   To see objects of different sizes
    -   Each pixel has *intensity value* and *Location address*
    -   Intensity value - represented as? **Digital Number**
    -   Location address - **row and column numbers**
    -   So how does the computer that receives it know which part of the image should be dark and light?
        -   Binary Numbers!!
        -   0s and 1s= on-off switch \_(cos computers like it that way!! we don't want it to be fussy- i'ts an inclusive approach)\_
        -   How does this happen??
            -   converting decimal system =\> Binary System
            -   00=0
            -   01=1
            -   10=2
            -   11=3
    -   OKay so assigning is done...but now is 00 the darkest or 11??? (see the image below- ![Binary= Dark and Light pixels Source: earthobservatory](images/pixelsblacnwhite.png){alt="Binary= Dark and Light pixels" fig-align="center"}
        -   00 = Darkest = black=⚫
        -   11= brightest = white = 💡
    -   The issue: as the image above it would create image with High CONTRAST.....SO?
    -   **Sapcecraft** uses a string 8-**bit** data (there can be
        -   **8 bit**= 8 binary numbers= 00000000
        -   Think of it as creating a gradient or adding more white color to your black gradually until u make your black white...get it? or adding more and more milk into your coffee, untill u dont taste coffee.
        -   Range in binary: **00000000** to **11111111**
        -   in decimal system; **0 to 255**
        -   so in spacecraft which is the darkest?? its the Same, just more numbers.
            -   **00000000** = darkest ⚫
            -   **11111111** = brightest 💡
    -   SO? what next???
        -   This entire set is sent back from spacecraft....
        -   binary numbers (btw 0-255)
-   Eg: Landsat 7 🛰️
    -   Sensor〰️ ✴️ : Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+)
    -   Bands: 8 band whiskbroom scanning radiometer
    -   Maximum Resolution: 15 meters
    -   Pixel (Each):
        -   area: area 15 m x 15 m
        -   pixel1 + pixel2 + pixel3.....n = Area
        -   Example: false image\> count number of green pixels= vegetation area
            -   ⬆️Resolution = ⬆️ Pixel Resolution
    -   Sensor= **⬆️Resolution** = detect **SMALL objects** 👁️ ![Pixel resolution](images/Pixelarea.png){width="535"}

#### Spectral Resolution

![Specification of LISS-III and LISS-IV sensors of IRS-P6. SOURCE: [ecoursesonline](http://ecoursesonline.iasri.res.in/mod/page/view.php?id=124941)](images/image-1028248859.png){fig-align="center"}

::: column-body
**Number of bands + wavelength width of each band**

-   BAND= narrow portion of the electromagnetic spectrum
-   short wavelength width= HIGHER resolution
-   ***Multi-spectral imagery***
-   *measure*: several wavelength bands (example: visible green or NIR)
-   Multi-spectral sensors: Landsat, Quickbird and Spot satellites
-   ***Hyperspectral imagery**:*
-   *measures*: energy in narrower and more numerous bands
-   more sensitive to variations in energy wavelengths = greater potential
-   Eg: used to check crop stress
:::

#### Radiometric Resolution

::: column-body
**Amount of information in each pixel!!**

-   ***sensitivity** of a remote sensor to variations in the **reflectance levels***
-   Information form? BIT= energy recorded
-   ⬆️Higher radiometric resolution = ⬆️more sensitive = ⬆️more precise picture *(a specific portion of the electromagnetic spectrum)=*
-   Sensitive how? - detecting small differences in reflectance values
-   small differences how? - ⬆️ more values stored= ⬆️ detecting btw slightest differnce of energy
-   How is the information recorded/ stored?
    -   in the bit for an exponet of 2
    -   eg: 8 bit = 2\^8 resolution = 256 potential digital values (refer example above)
    -   Application: water quality: distinguish btw subtle difference in ocen color
:::

![Advances in remote sensing technology have significantly improved satellite imagery. Among the advances are improvements in radiometric resolution, or how sensitive an instrument is to small differences in electromagnetic energy.

#### Temporal Resolution

::: column-body
**Satellite to complete an orbit and revisit the same observation area**

-   ***how often** a remote sensing platform can **provide coverage of an area***
-   Geo-stationary satellites = provide continuous sensing
-   eg cameras mounted on Airplanes **=** provide data for applications requiring more frequent sensing
-   Remote sensors located: fields or attached to agricultural equipment \>\> most frequent temporal resolution
-   normal orbiting satellites = provide data each time they pass over an area
-   Issues: cloud cover
-   eg: Polar orbiting satellites: temporal resolution = 1-16 days
    -   MODIS sensor: resolution of 1-2 days- daily changes
    -   OLI: narrow swath width: resolution of 16 days= bi-monthly changes= high spatial resolution
    -   high spatial resolution = narrower swath = molre time = low temporal resolution
:::

#### Multilayer Images

::: column-body
-   Of a **certain area/ one particular area**I on ground
    -   multiple measurements
    -   each measurement forms an image (carries specific information)
    -   STACKING these images = MULTILAYER IMAGE
-   MULTIPLELAYER image formation: (combination of)
    -   same
    -   different sensors
    -   subsidiary data
    -   *Combination eg:*
        -   3 layers = SPOT
        -   1 layer = ERS (synthetic aperture radar)
        -   1 layer = digital elevation map
:::

![](images/Multilayer%20Images.png){fig-align="center"}

#### Multispectral Image

::: column-body
-   few layers
-   image from a particular wavelength band
-   Eg:
    -   Sensors:
        -   **SPOT & HRV**
            -   three wavelength bands
                -   green (500 - 590 nm)
                -   red (610 - 680 nm)
                -   near infrared (790 - 890 nm)
            -   meaning: each pixel= three intensity value= corr to 3 bands
        -   **IKONOS**
            -   4 bands: Blue, Green, Red and Near Infrared
        -   **LANDSAT**
            -   7 Bands: blue, green, red, near-IR bands, two SWIR bands, and a thermal IR band
:::

#### Superspectral Image

::: column-body
-   more wavelength bands
-   Sensor:
    -   **MODIS**
        -   36 spectral bands: visible, near infrared, short-wave infrared to the thermal infrared
:::

#### Hyperspectral Image processing

::: column-body
-   Based on taking a **fraction of the electromagnetic** spectrum\> **breaking it into numerous bands** for theoretical analysis and computations.
-   Why do it?
    -   One can detect and identify objects more precisely compared to using only three bands information provided by a RGB camera.
-   not commercially available, only scientific investigation
-   **100+ contiguous spectral bands.**
-   characteristic spectrum of the target pixel is acquired in a hyperspectral image
-   precise spectral information
-   enables better characterisation
-   better identification of targets
-   Application:
    -   precision agriculture (crop: health, moisture status and maturity)
    -   coastal management ( phytoplanktons, pollution, bathymetry changes)
-   EOI satellite
-   Sensor:
    -   CHRIS: ESA'SPRABO satellite

1.  The above segments explains considerablity the extent of Remote Sensing application.
2.  Data Extracted application (just a few):
    -   forest fires
    -   pollution
    -   volcanic eruption
    -   Flooding
    -   weather
    -   crop growth
    -   carbon sinks
    -   forest covers
    -   City Growth
    -   Ocean floor
:::

## Reflection

::: column-body
1.  How to approach the subject initially to understand the concepts?\-\-- overwhelming resources, so stick to three good resources (combination of books or webpage) and don't deviate.
2.  The entire process is about measuring and understanding reflected and emitted radiation.
3.  It is essential to understand how EM waves and frequency work. It is like EMW has a life of its own everything it interacts with has some effect.
4.  Sensors are on-boarded on a satellite (active and passive)
5.  Multiple pixels make a band, where information is stored in a bit. The higher the bit meaning more information leading to better detection of features.
6.  Each band has a set of information Multiple bands with different information are stacked on each other to form an image. (can be a combination of various satellites)
7.  It is interesting to see how much is observed and accomplished through remote sensing.
