Welcome, to my Learning Diary! It comprises of summary, application and reflection on weekly learning of new concepts, processes, analysis and practice. I look forward to practice-oriented learning of the module, leading to building a robust technical proposal/implementation. I am curious to know which segment I would enjoy the most. I am a visual learner my Learning Diary shall reflect the same.
