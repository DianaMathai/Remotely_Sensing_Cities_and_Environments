A small slide presentation(maximum 9 slide) and hosted on GitHub - Xaringan OUTPUT - SENSOR 🌝➡️ [Sensor](https://dianamathai.github.io/Sensor-in-Xaringan-/newSensor.html#1)

## Application:

-   Making a publicly available document, that can grow with community contribution (only for GitHub users).
-   Easily accessible to users with internet and basic web accessibility knowledge.
-   Reproducible
-   Requires moderate to high proficiency of the medium
-   Interesting of individuals who love writing code, representing code, its output (maps, graphs, tables etc) and enjoy CSS- as this all outputs in a self contained web slide

## Reflection:

-   Benefits:
    -   Reproducible
    -   encourages collaboration and displays benefits of open source
    -   Enables users to use the medium to put things over internet.
    -   Dose not require in-depth knowledge of web-development to build a desired output.
    -   Resource to build one are easily accessible on web
-   Drawbacks:
    -   Requires internet accessibility

    -   Requires proficiency of the medium

    -   Not inclusive: as it targets a certain user type, cannot be used as a medium to engage contribution from learned diverse group with varying computer proficiency levels (would require capacity building).
